summary:
I think the relative position of the polyline and polygon and the x and y
        coordinates are set incorrectly. At the same time, the size of polygons and
        polylines need to be adjusted.
        Of course, there are also problems with the settings of the X and Y axes,
        and we need to set them up again.
The size of the panel may also affect the final display of the image,
        but this may not be an item that must be adjusted.
        I think the size of this panel is sufficient, but the x-axis and y-axis may be too large,
        and the coordinate position is wrong, so the panel cannot display the x-axis and y-axis completely.
        The part of the function, the area displayed by this function is a bit small, that is,
        the yellow part, we need to increase it and replace it with the correct coordinate position.
In fact, I tried a lot of methods and modified a lot of values on this issue, but in the end I just entertained the X and Y axes.
I really don't know how to expand the polyline and polygon in the horizontal direction and move it to the right.
